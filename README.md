# Twin-Lapia
Twin-lapia is a digital twin platform for sustainable tilapia farming. Using Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, it simulates fish growth, metabolism, and water-quality dynamics to optimize feeding, reduce waste, improve profitability, and lower the carbon footprint of aquaculture through predictive, data-driven decision support.
